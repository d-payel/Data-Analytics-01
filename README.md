# Hypothesis Testing and Exploratory Data Analysis
Welcome to my data analysis repository! This space showcases three hands-on case studies focused on hypothesis testing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving business insights using Python, SQL and visual storytelling.

# Projects Included
# [1. Customer Segmentation and Retention Analysis using SQL and Tableau](https://github.com/d-payel/Data-Analytics-01/tree/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20and%Retention%20Analysis%20using%20SQL)
# [2. YULU Bike Rentals Demand Analysis using Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/d-payel/Data-Analytics-01/tree/main/Hypothesis%20Testing%20on%20YULU%20Bike%20Rents)
# 3. Aerofit Data 
# 4. Netflix Case Study
- **Objective**: Analyze Netflix's content library to understand trends in show types, launch patterns, country-wise content distribution, and the correlation between release years and content ratings.
- **Skills Used**:

  - Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
  - Date parsing, mapping ratings to numeric values
  - Insights on top directors, actors, and launch strategies
- **Key Findings**:
  - TV Shows are launched mostly in specific months
