# Exploratory Data Analysis
Welcome to my data analysis repository! This space showcases two hands-on case studies focused on hypothesis testing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving business insights using Python and visual storytelling.

# Projects Included
# 1. Aerofit Data 
# 2. Netflix Case Study
- **Objective**: Analyze Netflix's content library to understand trends in show types, launch patterns, country-wise content distribution, and the correlation between release years and content ratings.
- **Skills Used**:
  - Data cleaning & transformation (pandas)
  - Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
  - Date parsing, mapping ratings to numeric values
  - Insights on top directors, actors, and launch strategies
- **Key Findings**:
  - TV Shows are launched mostly in specific months
  - Content rating trends vary mildly with time
  - US dominates the Netflix library distribution
